# Weather-Detector
This is a weather forecast app I created. By using current location it gives current weather situation.
It uses html, css, JavaScript, Twitter Bootstrap 3, jQuery.
All weather data is retrieved from openweathermap.org using their API, and is used JSON data that is returned.
Very soon it will be available in web, after few modification.
